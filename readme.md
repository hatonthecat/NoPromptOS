An OS that does not prompt the user for annoying popups at start up of LibreOffice nor Shutdown

Microsoft ensures finding or knowing about this option for shutdown time saving is nearly as obscure as expecting the average person to know about the registry. Then again, the average person wants to save their documents and might accidentally shutdown their PC. I am not one of those people. I have left my PC on accidentally tens of times and wasted electricity after believing I have pressed the "don't save" button after being prompted, even multiple times during the same shutdown, only for Windows to stay powered on after the screen goes into sleep mode. 

So Microsoft wastes tons of people's electric bills. There is something called Autosave.

99/100 times when I shutdown my PC its after i save everything and even if i manage to forget to save something the number of hours having to wait for the prompt to say no is saved and much higher than for all the times i might have forgotten to save and redo something. 

Today, I got a prompt saying I could not shutdown because I had an unsaved Notepad file open. Here's a suggestion. Offer an option to autosave a draft, or delete it automatically. Allow the prompt to happen once, and only once.

Steve Jobs compared it to how people waste hours, if not days at a stop light. https://sites.nicholas.duke.edu/delmeminfo/files/2012/07/The-Real-Leadership-Lessons-of-Steve-Jobs-HBR-l-Apr-2012.pdf

Bend Reality

"Jobs’s (in)famous ability to push people to do the impossible was dubbed by colleagues his Reality Distortion Field, after an
episode of Star Trek in which aliens create a convincing alternative reality through sheer mental force. An early example was
when Jobs was on the night shift at Atari and pushed Steve Wozniak to create a game called Breakout. Woz said it would take
months, but Jobs stared at him and insisted he could do it in four days. Woz knew that was impossible, but he ended up doing
it.
Those who did not know Jobs interpreted the Reality Distortion Field as a euphemism for bullying and lying. But those who
worked with him admitted that the trait, infuriating as it might be, led them to perform extraordinary feats. Because Jobs felt that
life’s ordinary rules didn’t apply to him, he could inspire his team to change the course of computer history with a small fraction
of the resources that Xerox or IBM had. “It was a self-fulfilling distortion,” recalls Debi Coleman, a member of the original Mac
team who won an award one year for being the employee who best stood up to Jobs. “You did the impossible because you
didn’t realize it was impossible.”
One day Jobs marched into the cubicle of Larry Kenyon, the engineer who was working on the Macintosh operating system,
and complained that it was taking too long to boot up. Kenyon started to explain why reducing the boot-up time wasn’t possible,
but Jobs cut him off. “If it would save a person’s life, could you find a way to shave 10 seconds off the boot time?” he asked.
Kenyon allowed that he probably could. Jobs went to a whiteboard and showed that if five million people were using the Mac
and it took 10 seconds extra to turn it on every day, that added up to 300 million or so hours a year—the equivalent of at least
100 lifetimes a year. After a few weeks Kenyon had the machine booting up 28 seconds faster."

So the idea of NoPromptOS is to minimize the number of prompts to effectively zero, unless absolutely necessary. There has to be a better way.
